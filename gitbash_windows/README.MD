# Name
git - the stupid content tracker

## Synopsis
git [--version] [--exec-path[=GIT_EXEC_PATH]] [--html-path]
    [-p|--paginate|--no-pager] [--no-replace-objects]
    [--bare] [--git-dir=GIT_DIR] [--work-tree=GIT_WORK_TREE]
    [--help] COMMAND [ARGS]
#### Description

 ```
Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.

See gittutorial(7) to get started, then see Everyday Git [1] for a useful minimum set of commands, and "man git-commandname" for documentation of each command. CVS users may also want to read gitcvs-migration(7). See the Git User's Manual [2] for a more in-depth introduction.

The COMMAND is either a name of a Git command (see below) or an alias as defined in the configuration file (see git-config(1)).

Formatted and hyperlinked version of the latest git documentation can be viewed at http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/.

Options
--version

Prints the git suite version that the git program came from.
--help
Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used commands. If the option --all or -a is given then all available commands are printed. If a git command is named this option will bring up the manual page for that command.
Other options are available to control how the manual page is displayed. See git-help(1) for more information, because git --help ... is converted internally into git help ....

--exec-path
Path to wherever your core git programs are installed. This can also be controlled by setting the GIT_EXEC_PATH environment variable. If no path is given, git will print the current setting and then exit.
--html-path
Print the path to wherever your git HTML documentation is installed and exit.
-p, --paginate
Pipe all output into less (or if set, $PAGER) if standard output is a terminal. This overrides the pager.<cmd> configuration options (see the "Configuration Mechanism" section below).
--no-pager
Do not pipe git output into a pager.
--git-dir=<path>
Set the path to the repository. This can also be controlled by setting the GIT_DIR environment variable. It can be an absolute path or relative path to current working directory.
--work-tree=<path>
Set the path to the working tree. The value will not be used in combination with repositories found automatically in a .git directory (i.e. $GIT_DIR is not set). This can also be controlled by setting the GIT_WORK_TREE environment variable and the core.worktree configuration variable. It can be an absolute path or relative path to the directory specified by --git-dir or GIT_DIR. Note: If --git-dir or GIT_DIR are specified but none of --work-tree, GIT_WORK_TREE and core.worktree is specified, the current working directory is regarded as the top directory of your working tree.
--bare
Treat the repository as a bare repository. If GIT_DIR environment is not set, it is set to the current working directory.
--no-replace-objects
Do not use replacement refs to replace git objects. See git-replace(1) for more information.
Further Documentation
See the references above to get started using git. The following is probably more detail than necessary for a first-time user.

The git concepts chapter of the user-manual [3] and gitcore-tutorial(7) both provide introductions to the underlying git architecture.

See gitworkflows(7) for an overview of recommended workflows.

See also the howto [4] documents for some useful examples.

The internals are documented in the GIT API documentation [5] .

LOW-LEVEL COMMANDS (PLUMBING)
Although git includes its own porcelain layer, its low-level commands are sufficient to support development of alternative porcelains. Developers of such porcelains might start by reading about git-update-index(1) and git-read-tree(1).

The interface (input, output, set of options and the semantics) to these low-level commands are meant to be a lot more stable than Porcelain level commands, because these commands are primarily for scripted use. The interface to Porcelain commands on the other hand are subject to change in order to improve the end user experience.

The following description divides the low-level commands into commands that manipulate objects (in the repository, index, and working tree), commands that interrogate and compare objects, and commands that move objects and references between repositories.

# Configuration Mechanism
Starting from 0.99.9 (actually mid 0.99.8.GIT), .git/config file is used to hold per-repository configuration options. It is a simple text file modeled after .ini format familiar to some people. Here is an example:
```
#
# A '#' or ';' character indicates a comment.
#

; core variables
[core]
        ; Don't trust file modes
        filemode = false

; user identity
[user]
        name = "Junio C Hamano"
        email = "junkio@twinsun.com"
Various commands read from the configuration file and adjust their operation accordingly. See git-config(1) for a list.
Identifier Terminology
<object>

Indicates the object name for any type of object.
<blob>
Indicates a blob object name.
<tree>
Indicates a tree object name.
<commit>
Indicates a commit object name.
<tree-ish>
Indicates a tree, commit or tag object name. A command that takes a <tree-ish> argument ultimately wants to operate on a <tree> object but automatically dereferences <commit> and <tag> objects that point at a <tree>.
<commit-ish>
Indicates a commit or tag object name. A command that takes a <commit-ish> argument ultimately wants to operate on a <commit> object but automatically dereferences <tag> objects that point at a <commit>.
<type>
Indicates that an object type is required. Currently one of: blob, tree, commit, or tag.
<file>
Indicates a filename - almost always relative to the root of the tree structure GIT_INDEX_FILE describes.
Symbolic Identifiers
Any git command accepting any <object> can also use the following symbolic notation:

HEAD

indicates the head of the current branch (i.e. the contents of $GIT_DIR/HEAD).
<tag>
a valid tag name (i.e. the contents of $GIT_DIR/refs/tags/<tag>).
<head>
a valid head name (i.e. the contents of $GIT_DIR/refs/heads/<head>).
For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in git-rev-parse(1).
FILE/DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
Please see the gitrepository-layout(5) document.
```
Read githooks(5) for more details about each hook.
```
Higher level SCMs may provide and manage additional information in the $GIT_DIR.
```
# Terminology
```
Please see gitglossary(7).

Environment Variables
Various git commands use the following environment variables:

The git Repository

These environment variables apply to all core git commands. Nb: it is worth noting that they may be used/overridden by SCMS sitting above git so take care if using Cogito etc.
GIT_INDEX_FILE

This environment allows the specification of an alternate index file. If not specified, the default of $GIT_DIR/index is used.
GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY
If the object storage directory is specified via this environment variable then the sha1 directories are created underneath - otherwise the default $GIT_DIR/objects directory is used.
GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES
Due to the immutable nature of git objects, old objects can be archived into shared, read-only directories. This variable specifies a ":" separated (on Windows ";" separated) list of git object directories which can be used to search for git objects. New objects will not be written to these directories.
GIT_DIR
If the GIT_DIR environment variable is set then it specifies a path to use instead of the default .git for the base of the repository.
GIT_WORK_TREE
Set the path to the working tree. The value will not be used in combination with repositories found automatically in a .git directory (i.e. $GIT_DIR is not set). This can also be controlled by the --work-tree command line option and the core.worktree configuration variable.
GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES
This should be a colon-separated list of absolute paths. If set, it is a list of directories that git should not chdir up into while looking for a repository directory. It will not exclude the current working directory or a GIT_DIR set on the command line or in the environment. (Useful for excluding slow-loading network directories.)
git Commits

GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL, GIT_AUTHOR_DATE, GIT_COMMITTER_NAME, GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL, GIT_COMMITTER_DATE, EMAIL
see git-commit-tree(1)
git Diffs

GIT_DIFF_OPTS
Only valid setting is "--unified=??" or "-u??" to set the number of context lines shown when a unified diff is created. This takes precedence over any "-U" or "--unified" option value passed on the git diff command line.
GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF
When the environment variable GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is set, the program named by it is called, instead of the diff invocation described above. For a path that is added, removed, or modified, GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is called with 7 parameters:
path old-file old-hex old-mode new-file new-hex new-mode
where:
<old|new>-file
are files GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF can use to read the contents of <old|new>,
<old|new>-hex
are the 40-hexdigit SHA1 hashes,
<old|new>-mode
are the octal representation of the file modes.
+ The file parameters can point at the user's working file (e.g. new-file in "git-diff-files"), /dev/null (e.g. old-file when a new file is added), or a temporary file (e.g. old-file in the index). GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF should not worry about unlinking the temporary file --- it is removed when GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF exits.
+ For a path that is unmerged, GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is called with 1 parameter, <path>.

other

GIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY
A number controlling the amount of output shown by the recursive merge strategy. Overrides merge.verbosity. See git-merge(1)
GIT_PAGER
This environment variable overrides $PAGER. If it is set to an empty string or to the value "cat", git will not launch a pager. See also the core.pager option in git-config(1).
GIT_SSH
If this environment variable is set then git fetch and git push will use this command instead of ssh when they need to connect to a remote system. The $GIT_SSH command will be given exactly two arguments: the username@host (or just host) from the URL and the shell command to execute on that remote system.
To pass options to the program that you want to list in GIT_SSH you will need to wrap the program and options into a shell script, then set GIT_SSH to refer to the shell script.

Usually it is easier to configure any desired options through your personal .ssh/config file. Please consult your ssh documentation for further details.

GIT_FLUSH
If this environment variable is set to "1", then commands such as git blame (in incremental mode), git rev-list, git log, and git whatchanged will force a flush of the output stream after each commit-oriented record have been flushed. If this variable is set to "0", the output of these commands will be done using completely buffered I/O. If this environment variable is not set, git will choose buffered or record-oriented flushing based on whether stdout appears to be redirected to a file or not.
GIT_TRACE
If this variable is set to "1", "2" or "true" (comparison is case insensitive), git will print trace: messages on stderr telling about alias expansion, built-in command execution and external command execution. If this variable is set to an integer value greater than 1 and lower than 10 (strictly) then git will interpret this value as an open file descriptor and will try to write the trace messages into this file descriptor. Alternatively, if this variable is set to an absolute path (starting with a / character), git will interpret this as a file path and will try to write the trace messages into it.
Discussion
More detail on the following is available from the git concepts chapter of the user-manual [3] and gitcore-tutorial(7).

A git project normally consists of a working directory with a ".git" subdirectory at the top level. The .git directory contains, among other things, a compressed object database representing the complete history of the project, an "index" file which links that history to the current contents of the working tree, and named pointers into that history such as tags and branch heads.

The object database contains objects of three main types: blobs, which hold file data; trees, which point to blobs and other trees to build up directory hierarchies; and commits, which each reference a single tree and some number of parent commits.

The commit, equivalent to what other systems call a "changeset" or "version", represents a step in the project's history, and each parent represents an immediately preceding step. Commits with more than one parent represent merges of independent lines of development.

All objects are named by the SHA1 hash of their contents, normally written as a string of 40 hex digits. Such names are globally unique. The entire history leading up to a commit can be vouched for by signing just that commit. A fourth object type, the tag, is provided for this purpose.

When first created, objects are stored in individual files, but for efficiency may later be compressed together into "pack files".

Named pointers called refs mark interesting points in history. A ref may contain the SHA1 name of an object or the name of another ref. Refs with names beginning ref/head/ contain the SHA1 name of the most recent commit (or "head") of a branch under development. SHA1 names of tags of interest are stored under ref/tags/. A special ref named HEAD contains the name of the currently checked-out branch.

The index file is initialized with a list of all paths and, for each path, a blob object and a set of attributes. The blob object represents the contents of the file as of the head of the current branch. The attributes (last modified time, size, etc.) are taken from the corresponding file in the working tree. Subsequent changes to the working tree can be found by comparing these attributes. The index may be updated with new content, and new commits may be created from the content stored in the index.

The index is also capable of storing multiple entries (called "stages") for a given pathname. These stages are used to hold the various unmerged version of a file when a merge is in progress.
